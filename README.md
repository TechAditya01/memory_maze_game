## 🎮 Game Concept

**Memory Maze** tests your short-term memory and logic. A safe path is shown for a few seconds, and then it's hidden. You must reach the goal (bottom-right) from the start (top-left) by recalling the path in order. Each wrong step ends the game.

- 🔍 Memory challenge with path preview

- ✅ Win/loss detection with on-screen messages
- 🎨 Minimalist grid UI using Pygame
- 🧠 Path generated randomly every time
